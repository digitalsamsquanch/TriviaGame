/*
- create object with all the questions
    - each question will have an index, the actual question itself, possible answers, and the correct answer.
- create startGame function that will fill in the html template with the question and the possible answers (potentially randomized order to prevent cheating)
    - make a timer start as soon as the game starts
- player must either select an answer and submit to move on to the next question or have the time run out and move on to the next question
- the correct/incorrect message will render for 5 seconds and the correct answer will render regardless
